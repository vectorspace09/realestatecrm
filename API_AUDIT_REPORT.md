## Frontend Integration Status

### âœ… Properly Integrated Endpoints
All endpoints are properly integrated in the frontend with:
- Correct API calls using `apiRequest` or `fetch`

- Cache invalidation using React Query
- Loading states and optimistic updates

### âœ… Authentication Integration
- All endpoints use `isAuthenticated` middleware
- Frontend handles 401 errors with automatic redirect to login
- User context properly passed in all requests

### âœ… Real-time Updates
- React Query cache invalidation on mutations
- Notification system for real-time updates
- Proper refetch triggers after actions

## Performance Optimizations

- Efficient database queries with filtering
- Proper indexing considerations in schema

## Security
- All endpoints require authentication
- Input validation using Zod schemas
- SQL injection protection through ORM
- User context validation on all operations

## Conclusion
âœ… **All API endpoints are now present and properly integrated**
âœ… **All POST endpoints exist for creation operations**
âœ… **Complete CRUD operations available for all entities**
âœ… **Real-time features working correctly**
âœ… **Authentication and authorization properly implemented**

The API is now fully functional with no missing endpoints. All frontend integrations are working correctly.
